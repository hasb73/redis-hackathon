# Evaluation Module

## Overview
Comprehensive performance evaluation and stress testing for the anomaly detection system.

## Files
- `hdfs_anomaly_injection_loader.py` - Create jsonl files with varying anomaly ratios
- `anomaly_evaluation.py` - Main evaluation suite that uses the anomaly detection service against the file generated by the
- `anomaly-injection-tests/` - Test datasets with varying anomaly rates
- `evaluation_results/` - Performance metrics and analysis reports

## Features
- **Multi-rate Testing**: Evaluates performance at different anomaly percentages (5%-40%)
- **Performance Metrics**: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Processing Time
- **Comparative Analysis**: Model performance comparison across scenarios
- **Report Generation**: Automated CSV and markdown reporting


## Dependencies

- Anomaly detection service should be running on port 8000 with the loaded ensemble model
- Kafka broker (producer) should be available and running on port 9092
- Embedding service should be available and running on port 8000


## Usage
```bash
# Generate test datasets (run from project root)
python3 evaluation/hdfs_anomaly_injection_loader.py

# Run evaluation on specific anomaly rate ( example 40%)
python3 evaluation/anomaly_evaluation.py evaluation/anomaly-injection-tests/hdfs_eval_test_40.jsonl

# Results saved to: evaluation/evaluation_results/
```
